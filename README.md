#### Hey ðŸ‘‹, I'm a full-stack engineer working remotely.  
Current stack is `Rails`/`Vue` but have also worked with `Nuxt` `Nest` `Yii2` `Next` `React`

If you like Vue3, check this out then - **[vue3-side-panel](https://github.com/headmandev/vue3-side-panel)** <br />
There was no such modals or I'm bad at looking for components so I've created one for my own project
