#### Hey ðŸ‘‹, I'm a full-stack engineer working remotely.  
I mostly use <b>vue3/rails</b> but have also worked with <b>nuxt/nest/yii2/next/react</b>

If you like Vue3 check this out - **[vue3-side-panel](https://github.com/headmandev/vue3-side-panel)** <br />
There was no such modals or I'm bad at looking for components so I've created one for my own project
