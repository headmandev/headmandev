**Hey ðŸ‘‹, I'm a full-stack engineer working remotely.**<br />
Current & favorite stack is `Rails`/`Vue` but have also worked with `Nuxt` `Nest` `Yii2` `Next` `React`

If you like Vue3, check this out then:

**[VUE3-SIDE-PANEL](https://github.com/headmandev/vue3-side-panel)** <br /> 
 ![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/dm/vue3-side-panel)<br /> 

----
There are no flexible side modal panels like this or I'm bad at looking for vue components.  <br />
Anyway I've created one for my own project - try it out [ https://vue3-side-panel.netlify.app/](https://vue3-side-panel.netlify.app/)
