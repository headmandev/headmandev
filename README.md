<h3>Hey ðŸ‘‹, I'm Dmitry Golovin. A full-stack engineer working remotely. </h3>  
  
I mostly use **vue3/rails** but have also often worked with **nuxt/nest/next/react**

If you like Vue3 like me check this out - **[vue3-side-panel](https://github.com/headmandev/vue3-side-panel)** <br />
There was no such modals or I'm bad at looking for components so I've created one for my own project
